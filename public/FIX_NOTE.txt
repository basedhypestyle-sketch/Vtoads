Fixed package.json:
- Locked Next.js dependency to 14.3.1 (avoids ETARGET when Vercel's npm can't find requested version)
- Set engines.node to 18.x for Vercel compatibility

If deployment still fails, try:
- Clear Vercel build cache or trigger a new deployment with "Clear cache and redeploy".
- Check Vercel's Node/npm version settings in Project > Settings > General > Build & Development Settings.
